This is the readme file for my Spam Detection Capstone.

The breakdown of the project is as follows:

1 - Python Notebooks:
    - AK_Amazon - CellPhones and Acc Reviews - EDA 1
    - AK_Amazon - CellPhones and Acc Reviews - Modelling 2
    - AK_Amazon - CellPhones and Acc Reviews - Advanced Modelling 3 (Please run on Google Colab due to ML Pipeline and GridSearch)

2 - Data:
    - Cell_Phones_and_Accessories.json (original dataset)
    - Cell_data_sampled.csv (first sample - 5% of the original dataset)
    - Spam_sampled (all spam reviews extracted into a csv file)
    - Real_sampled (all real reviews extracted into a csv file)
    - Cell_data_sampled_clean (the cleaned dataset after EDA to be used for the modelling in Notebook 2)
    - X_remainder_vect_tfidf.csv (TF-IDF Method Vectorized Independent Variables remainder dataset for the advanced modelling in Notebook 3)
    - X_test_vect_tfidf.csv (TF-IDF Method Vectorized Independent Variables test dataset for the advanced modelling in Notebook 3)
    - y_remainder.csv (Dependent Variables remainder dataset for the advanced modelling in Notebook 3)
    - y_test.csv (Dependent Variables test dataset for the advanced modelling in Notebook 3)
    - Data Note: 
		- Please keep data within Data folder for loading into notebooks
		- Data files were too big in size, and have not been included as part of the final submission zip folder
		- Please find all the data saved in the Google Drive folder link below (Data is all saved in the Data folder)

3 - Conda environment files:
    - base_env.yml (please load this environment for Notebook 1)
    - boosting_env.yml (please load this environment for Notebooks 2 and 3)

4 - Final Report (word doc and pdf)

5 - Images (saved visualizations from notebooks used in the presentation and report)

Viewing Order:

1 - Final Report to get a high level overview of the project
2 - Set-up conda environment for running notebooks
3 - Notebooks (1 --> 2 --> 3)
